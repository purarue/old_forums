# forum_parser

Parses post/metadata from random forums I used in the past. I don't use any of these anymore, but they contain random thoughts I had back then, so parsing them so I have access to them.

Putting these up here as reference. I have so little posts on some of these that didn't have to worry about pagination.

All the posts get pulled out into a common schema:

```
forum_name: str
post_title: str  (name/title of the post)
post_url: str  (url to the post)
post_contents: str  (what I actually said)
dt: epoch datetime
```

To be used as historical data as part of [HPI](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI)

Based on code from [`steamscraper`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/steamscraper)

As an example; `minecraft_forum.py`

```
python3 ./minecraft_forum.py <username> --to-file ./minecraft_forum.json
